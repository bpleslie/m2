	Installation
	-------------
		git clone https://github.com/ryanstreet/magento2-vagrant.git m2/
			(includes some extra stuff for development mode)
		git submodule init
		git submodule update

		vagrant up
		composer install
			(packagist)

		gui install

		php bin/magento
			CLI tool like magerun

			setup:static-content:deploy
				run for the first time to initialize the admin panel. No static content in developer mode


	Working With M2
	----------------
		core -> lib/Magento/Framework

		Creating a module
		------------------
		registration.php
			can copy from elsewhere, just need to make sure the module name is correct

		etc/module.xml

		php bin/magento module:enable Interactone_Sample
		php bin/magento setup:upgrade
			(runs upgrade scripts for schema & data in any modules that need it)

		DO NOT RE-RUN COMPILE COMMAND (unless necessary for the resources within)

		event observers
			events.xml
				frontend / admin
			execute method rather than module declaration (like controllers)

		plugins
			override core methods
			before, after, "around"
				around 
					gives you the method to call so you can do stuff before & after without having to use 2 plugins
					multiple people can alter the same method without conflicts

					\Closure $proceed
						2nd parameter
						ran as $proceed() (with $ and ())

		preference
			fundamentally override functionality of a class
			not just overriding one method -- rewriting
			giving control to something else

		service contract
			no matter what, the methods will always be the same in m2
			ensures stability
			if you're altering something w/ a service contract, you must uphold that service contract
			all web api methods will always work because of this
			all service contracts are interfaces, not all interfaces are service contracts

		create a new controller
			create a route
				routes.xml
				creates front name
					first part of the URL
			create a class

			URL structure
				frontName/Folder/Controller

			namespace 	= path to the controller file
			class 		= controller file name
			extends 	= framework class it should extend

			can use 'use' then action path.. extends the file name
				if there are conflicts, can 'use path as alias' then extends alias

		create plugin
			di.xmls
				type name 	= class you want to intercept
				plugin name = unique name
				type 		= new class

				this can be in:
					etc = global
					etc/frontend = frontend
					etc/adminhtml = admin

			model/plugin/hello.php
				namespace
				class

			*plugins are always models

		create preference
			add preference to di.xml
				for 	= core class
				type 	= new class
			create new class
				add core class to constructor

		arguments
			array
			string
			object
			constants
			boolean
			number
			null

			virtual type
				equivalent of class alias
				allows to substitute one class for another
				if you need a unique class, but not necessarily unique functionality
				name = virtual class
				type = base class

		Injectables
			what if the class you're injecting relies on external dependencies
				ex: need the product model, how do you get it? what if somethin else is loading? how do I inject a 'non-injectable'? catalog model requires the db

					repositories & factories
					repository
						allows you to get non-injectable objects
						if you need a product, you can inject the product repository to get the actual model that you need

						when it's called inside a constructor, the repo itself is not being requested

					factory
						generates non-injectable objects
						append Factory to any class, Magento will generate that factory automgically (var/generation)
							Get the original non-injectable instance by calling create()

			what if you need a class injected and you only need it for part of what it needs?
				proxy
					will defer the creation of an object until you need it rather than calling some super heavy class that does a lot or has a bunch of dependencies

					can be created the same as a factory or you can declare in di.xml

			auto-generated classes need to be deleted when you edit the base class

		customizing m2
			1. observer
			2. plugin
			3. preference


		ORM
			pretty much the same in m2 as it was in m1
				_construct & init
			model, resource model, collection
			magic methods are available if it extends the abstract data class

		Installation and upgrade scripts
			Setup/InstallSchema.php
			Setup/InstallData.php

			install and upgrade scripts aren't done the same way in m2:
				1 file for installing data, 1 to install schema
				1 file to update data, 1 to update schema

		Views
			template, blocks, layout xml
			difference
				fallback system
					everything within design folders falls back
					in m2 you can configure how fallbacks work
						define your own inheritance system
						falls back through parent themes to the module 

			frontend, admin and base (both front & admin)

			registration.php
				registers theme

			theme.xml
				set parent, title, and preview image

			editing templates when writing a module should be done within the module..
				let the front end devs deal with themes for customizing it

			layout files are merged and parsed just like m1
				one layout file per handle
				within layouts directory, will use default before the layout handle files

			Themes
				create new theme:
					registration.php
					theme.xml
						(image isn't required, but it _is_ if you include the preview node)

				themes are area-specific: admin or frontend

			Block classes
				lib/internal/Magento/framework/view/
				use $block in templates, not $this
					$this class = Magento\Framework\View\TemplateEngine\Php, where block is the actual block
				lifecycle
					_prepareLayout()
						models are set
					toHtml()
						still has _beforeHtml, _toHtml, and _afterHtml
						if there's a template, it'll call fetchView
							validator,
							template engine pool, (can be switched out, but you'll use this 99% of the time)
							render template context (template file)
				View models
					business logic that applies to view layer
				Create

					$block->insert (to add child block to the top)
					$block->append (to add child block to the end)

					$block->assign('variable', 'value')


			Container
				m1 text list

				references like m1
					referenceBlock (same as m1)
					referenceContainer
					block node
					'move' node (from / to) *new in m2

				action methods are back in m2

				update = take that layout and put it in this layout (just like m1)

			View/Layout/etc/ as the .xsd files that tell you what you can use in layout files
